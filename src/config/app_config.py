DISCOVER_DESCRIPTION = 'The research project uses the lens of co-worlding to develop environmental media approaches that aim to support and foster biodiversity in urban areas by extending design research to natural, cultural and media sciences. In the projectâ€™s three case studies, media infrastructures were installed in three sites of human-environment entanglements: in the Merian Gardens near Basel, in a former port area of the city of Basel, and in a nature reserve in Reinach (Basel agglomeration). "Discover" is a map-based publication of the research results prepared for the public.'
