The diagram shows the number of detections per time unit. You can select a shorter time frame by holding down the mouse button and dragging over the measurement data in the diagram or by using the small menu at the top right."

The diagram shows the bird species detected per day (colour-coded). You can select a shorter time frame by holding down the mouse button and dragging over the measurement data in the diagram or by using the small menu at the top right."

DISCOVER_DESCRIPTION = 'The research project uses the lens of co-worlding to develop environmental media approaches that aim to support and foster biodiversity in urban areas by extending design research to natural, cultural and media sciences. In the projectâ€™s three case studies, media infrastructures were installed in three sites of human-environment entanglements: in the Merian Gardens near Basel, in a former port area of the city of Basel, and in a nature reserve in Reinach (Basel agglomeration). "Discover" is a map-based publication of the research results prepared for the public.'
